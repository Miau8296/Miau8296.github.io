THIS IS MY DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO

I am currently a freelancer specializing excel database and data entry with different clients across the world.
I am also a part-time Airbnb co-host of one of our family businesses.
I have a strong interest in data analytics and I'm confident enough that I have the basic 
skills required as a data analyst. Please feel free to check all my projects and queries I made 
from Kaggle and the courses I attended online.
